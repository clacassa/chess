- Clarify some parts of the 'game' translation unit (the process_move functions could be merged)
- Improve the move computation (Wrong behavior beyond a 2 plies depth)
- Make the computer able to castle (currently a glitch where the King goes to f1 or c1)
- Improve the computer (for the moment it only plays random moves)
- Maybe when I will have time, implement a real chess engine that can be used for game analysis
